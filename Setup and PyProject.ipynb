    "### 1. **What is a pyproject.toml file?**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - TOML (Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language): It’s a simple configuration file format (like JSON or YAML) but is easier to read and write. \n",
    "  - TOML is becoming the standard for Python packaging metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Why pyproject.toml is important:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - It was introduced with PEP 518 to modernize Python package building. Previously, everything was done using setup.py but now pyproject.toml allows for more flexibility, better dependency management, and cleaner project configuration.\n",
    "  - It centralizes metadata about the project: project name, version, dependencies, authors, etc.\n",
    "  - It supports various build systems (like setuptools, poetry, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Explaining sections of pyproject.toml:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - [project]: Defines the basic project information (name, version, description, authors).\n",
    "  - [tool.setuptools]: Specifies that setuptools is being used to build the project.\n",
    "  - [tool.setuptools.dynamic]: Links the external files (like requirements.txt) to dynamically pull dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **setup.py with the advent of pyproject.toml:**\n",
    "  - Some tasks previously handled by setup.py (like metadata) are now managed by `pyproject.toml`. However, setup.py can still be used, especially if you have complex build steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **How do setup.py, pyproject.toml, and requirements.txt work together?**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `pyproject.toml`: It’s now the central place for project metadata. Instead of defining your dependencies and project information in setup.py, you can define them in pyproject.toml.\n",
    "    - As we did in your project, the line [tool.setuptools.dynamic] dependencies = {file = \"requirements txt\"} links your requirements.txt file to the TOML file, so when the project is built, the dependencies are fetched from requirements.txt.\n",
    "  - `setup.py`: While it’s still used for custom builds and configurations, most of the basic functionalities (like metadata and dependencies) is being transferred to pyproject.toml. You might still keep a minimal `setup.py` if you have custom build steps, but for many projects, it’s not necessary anymore with pyproject.toml.\n",
    "  - `requirements.txt`: It lists all project dependencies and their versions.\n",
    "    - When you run pip install -r requirements.txt, it ensures that all dependencies are installed. The pyproject.toml file can reference it (as we did) so that package dependencies are automatically pulled from there."
